## Quick Start

### Installation

The competition system is included with IdeaRank. Ensure you have the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install idearank[competition]
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from idearank import (
    CompetitionPipeline, Player, Coach, Challenge, 
    MatchStatus, CoachingType, FactorType
)
from idearank.providers.embeddings import SentenceTransformerEmbeddingProvider
from idearank.providers.chroma import ChromaProvider

# Initialize providers
embedding_provider = SentenceTransformerEmbeddingProvider()
chroma_provider = ChromaProvider(collection_name="competition")

# Create pipeline
pipeline = CompetitionPipeline(
    embedding_provider=embedding_provider,
    chroma_provider=chroma_provider
)

# Create a challenge
challenge = Challenge(
    id="logic_puzzle",
    title="The Missing Number Sequence",
    description="Given the sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ? Find the next number.",
    difficulty_level=6,
    time_limit_minutes=15,
    constraints=["Must show step-by-step reasoning"],
    ground_truth={"answer": 42, "pattern": "n(n+1)"}
)

# Create players
player1 = Player(id="alice", name="Alice Chen")
player2 = Player(id="bob", name="Bob Rodriguez")

# Create coaches
coach1 = Coach(id="coach1", name="Dr. Sarah Johnson")

# Register entities
pipeline.register_challenge(challenge)
pipeline.register_player(player1)
pipeline.register_player(player2)
pipeline.register_coach(coach1)

# Create and start a match
match = pipeline.create_match(
    challenge_id=challenge.id,
    player1_id=player1.id,
    player2_id=player2.id,
    coach1_id=coach1.id,
    coach2_id=coach1.id
)

pipeline.start_match(match.id)

# Add reasoning nodes (simulated)
pipeline.add_reasoning_node(
    match_id=match.id,
    player_id=player1.id,
    content="Looking at the sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30",
    confidence=0.7,
    factor_contributions={FactorType.UNIQUENESS: 0.3, FactorType.QUALITY: 0.4}
)

# Add coaching intervention
pipeline.add_coaching_event(
    match_id=match.id,
    player_id=player1.id,
    coach_id=coach1.id,
    coaching_type=CoachingType.STRATEGY,
    content="Remember to consider multiple approaches"
)

# Complete the match
results = pipeline.complete_match(match.id)
print(f"Player 1 Score: {results['scores'][player1.id].raw_score:.3f}")
```

## Architecture

- `ReasoningNode`: Individual reasoning steps with factor contributions
- `CoachingEvent`: Coaching interventions with timing and content

#### 2. **Scoring Engine** (`competition_scorer.py`)
- `IdeaRankThoughtScorer`: Main scoring engine implementing the technical appendix
- **Gate Calculations**: Outcome Validity (O) and Constraint Compliance (X)
- **Factor Scoring**: U, C, L, Q, T, D factors with anti-gaming measures
- **Coaching Analysis**: Impact measurement and plan adherence

#### 3. **Pipeline Management** (`competition_pipeline.py`)
- `CompetitionPipeline`: Main orchestrator for match lifecycle
- **Match Management**: Creation, execution, and completion
- **Real-time Processing**: Reasoning trace collection and coaching events
- **Integrity Protocols**: Ledger hashing and validation

#### 4. **Visualization System** (`competition_visualizer.py`)
- `CompetitionVisualizer`: Reason Map Overlay implementation
- **Visual Encoding**: Node colors, edge thickness, halo glow effects
- **Interactive Features**: Factor isolation, replay, detailed breakdowns
- **Export Capabilities**: Data export for external visualization

## Scoring System

### Factor Computation

Each factor is calculated using specific methods from the technical appendix:

| Factor | Method | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **U** (Uniqueness) | Novelty z-score ‚Üí sigmoid | Novelty vs league corpus |
| **C** (Cohesion) | Reasoning map analysis | Structural consistency, linguistic coherence |
| **L** (Learning) | Early/late checkpoint delta | Skill gain function over time |
| **Q** (Quality) | Human & AI rubric | Readability, completeness, clarity |
| **T** (Trust) | Test logs, citations | Pass rate √ó citation quality |
| **D** (Density) | Tokens vs valid nodes | Information-per-step compression |

### Gate Formulas

#### Outcome Validity (O)
```
O = 0.7 √ó correctness + 0.3 √ó robustness
```

#### Constraint Compliance (X)
```
X = 1 - violation_penalty
```

### Anti-Gaming Measures

- **Multiplicative scoring** prevents single-factor dominance
- **Balanced performance** across factors yields higher scores
- **Extreme specialization** results in score penalties

## Visualization Schema

### Reason Map Overlays

The visualization system implements the multi-dimensional encoding:

#### Visual Encoding
- **Node color** ‚Üí Factor weight contribution
  - Hue indicates dominant factor (blue=Cohesion, green=Learning, etc.)
  - Saturation indicates contribution magnitude
- **Edge thickness** ‚Üí Cohesion strength
  - Thicker edges represent stronger logical connections
  - Dashed edges indicate tentative reasoning
- **Halo glow** ‚Üí Coaching intervention zones
  - Glowing nodes indicate post-timeout reasoning
  - Glow intensity correlates with coaching impact

#### Interactive Features
- **Factor isolation**: View individual factor contributions
- **Replay sequences**: Variable speed reasoning playback
- **Alternative paths**: Compare reasoning branches not taken
- **Detailed breakdowns**: Per-node factor analysis

## Integrity Protocols

### Ledger Hashing
- **SHA-256** cryptographic hashing of match data
- **Merkle tree structure** for efficient partial verification
- **RFC 3161** compliant trusted timestamps

### Replay Validation
- **Deterministic execution** with fixed random seeds
- **Bit-level comparison** for AI system verification
- **Ghost replay protocols** for human reasoning validation

### Anti-Gaming Measures
- **Multiplicative scoring** prevents optimization of single factors
- **Balance requirements** across all scoring dimensions
- **Penalty systems** for extreme specialization

## Output Metrics

Each match produces comprehensive performance metrics:

- **IR-T Raw Score (0‚Äì1)**: Unmodified IdeaRank-Thought score
- **IR-T Class Adjusted Score**: Raw score with class-specific adjustments
- **Coach Impact Index (CI)**: Coaching effectiveness [-1.0, +1.0]
- **Meta Rating (MR)**: Long-term performance composite
- **Entropy Index (EI)**: Reasoning tree efficiency for tiebreaks
