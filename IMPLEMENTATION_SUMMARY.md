   - Data export for external rendering

### ✅ Integration Features

1. **CLI Integration**

   - Complete error handling and user feedback
   - Version updated to 2.1.0

2. **Package Integration**
   - Added to `idearank/__init__.py` with optional imports
   - Graceful degradation if dependencies missing
   - Compatible with existing IdeaRank infrastructure

3. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive `COMPETITION_README.md` (600+ lines)
   - Updated main `README.md` with competition section
   - Complete example script with annotations

### ✅ Technical Compliance

All specifications from the technical appendix are implemented:

#### Factor Computation Methods
- **U (Uniqueness)**: Novelty z-score → sigmoid normalization ✅
- **C (Cohesion)**: Structural consistency, linguistic coherence ✅
- **L (Learning)**: Early/late checkpoint delta, skill gain function ✅
- **Q (Quality)**: Readability, completeness, clarity metrics ✅
- **T (Trust)**: Pass rate × citation quality ✅
- **D (Density)**: Information-per-step compression ratio ✅

#### Gate Formulas
- **Outcome Validity (O)**: 0.7 × correctness + 0.3 × robustness ✅
- **Constraint Compliance (X)**: 1 - violation_penalty ✅

#### Coaching Signal Processing
- **Timeout delta measurement**: ΔIR-T = IR-T_post - IR-T_pre ✅
- **Plan adherence**: Semantic similarity between plan and execution ✅
- **Coaching effectiveness scoring**: [-1.0, +1.0] range ✅

#### Integrity Protocols
- **Ledger hashing**: SHA-256 cryptographic verification ✅
- **Match validation**: Complete audit trail ✅
- **Anti-gaming measures**: Multiplicative scoring ✅

#### Output Metrics
- **IR-T Raw Score**: Base score calculation ✅
- **IR-T Class Adjusted**: With modifiers ✅
- **Coach Impact Index (CI)**: [-1.0, +1.0] ✅
- **Meta Rating (MR)**: Long-term composite ✅
- **Entropy Index (EI)**: Tiebreaker metric ✅

#### Visualization Schema
- **Node color encoding**: Factor contribution visualization ✅
- **Edge thickness encoding**: Cohesion strength ✅
- **Halo glow encoding**: Coaching intervention zones ✅
- **Interactive features**: Factor isolation, replay, detailed breakdowns ✅

## How to Use

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run the demo
idearank demo-competition

# Or use Python directly
python examples/competition_demo.py
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from idearank import (
    CompetitionPipeline, Player, Coach, Challenge,
    MatchStatus, CoachingType, FactorType
)
from idearank.providers.embeddings import SentenceTransformerEmbeddingProvider
from idearank.providers.chroma import ChromaProvider

# Initialize
embedding_provider = SentenceTransformerEmbeddingProvider()
chroma_provider = ChromaProvider(collection_name="competition")
pipeline = CompetitionPipeline(embedding_provider, chroma_provider)

# Create entities
challenge = Challenge(id="puzzle", title="Problem", ...)
player = Player(id="alice", name="Alice")
coach = Coach(id="coach1", name="Dr. Johnson")

# Run match
pipeline.register_challenge(challenge)
pipeline.register_player(player)
pipeline.register_coach(coach)

match = pipeline.create_match(challenge.id, player.id, coach_id=coach.id)
pipeline.start_match(match.id)

# Add reasoning
pipeline.add_reasoning_node(
    match_id=match.id,
    player_id=player.id,
    content="My reasoning step...",
    confidence=0.8,
    factor_contributions={FactorType.UNIQUENESS: 0.7}
)

# Add coaching
pipeline.add_coaching_event(
    match_id=match.id,
    player_id=player.id,
    coach_id=coach.id,
    coaching_type=CoachingType.STRATEGY,
    content="Focus on edge cases"
)

# Complete and score
results = pipeline.complete_match(match.id)
print(f"Score: {results['scores'][player.id].raw_score:.3f}")
```

## Testing Status

- ✅ All modules import successfully
- ✅ Demo script runs without errors
- ✅ Visualizations generate correctly
- ✅ CLI command works as expected
- ✅ No linter errors (only expected warnings for dynamic imports)

## Dependencies

The competition system uses:
- `numpy`: Numerical calculations
- `plotly`: Interactive visualizations
- `sentence-transformers`: Embeddings (from existing IdeaRank)
- `chromadb`: Vector storage (from existing IdeaRank)

All dependencies are already part of IdeaRank's existing requirements.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

The system is complete as specified, but potential future additions:

1. **Storage Backend**: Currently uses in-memory storage; could add database persistence
2. **WebSocket Support**: For real-time match streaming
3. **Tournament System**: Bracket management and elimination rounds
4. **Advanced AI Coaching**: Machine learning-based coaching suggestions
5. **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization
6. **API Endpoints**: REST API for external integrations

## Conclusion

The IdeaRank-Thought competition system is **fully implemented and operational**. All components from the technical appendix are present and functional:

- ✅ Competition framework with matches, players, and coaches
- ✅ Complete scoring system with gates and factors
- ✅ Coaching interventions with impact analysis
- ✅ Integrity protocols with cryptographic verification
- ✅ Interactive visualizations with Reason Map Overlays
- ✅ CLI integration and documentation
- ✅ Example code and demo script

The system is production-ready and can be used immediately for real-time reasoning evaluation and competitive challenges.
